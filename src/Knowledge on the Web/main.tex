\begin{abstract}
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of representing and sharing knowledge on the web.
It takes relevant literature in the field of knowledge representation and the Semantic Web into account.
The overview itself is twofold and starts out by presenting the groundwork involved in representing knowledge in digital environments.
Ontologies help us define reality while logic enables reasoning in this context.
Building onto the examined concepts the second part focusses on the Semantic Web and its goal to reshape how humans and machines share knowledge on a global scale.
While a lot of time and resources has been spent on developing the global web of data the full potential, as envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee \cite{Berners-lee2002b}, remains yet to be unleashed.

    This review paper provides an overview of established game design frameworks in chronological order: MDA by Hunicke et al. (2004), the elemental tetrad by Schell (2008), and MTDA+N by Ralph and Monu (2014).
    It delves deeper into mechanics and story from the elemental tetrad.
    Mechanics make up the basics of a game and are categorised by Schell according to their main characteristic and effect on gameplay.
    Interactive storytelling directly operates on the experience level.
    Focusing on creating the feeling of freedom avoids a range of problems introduced by interactive storytelling.
    The last part of this paper investigates the ten research areas of artificial intelligence in games as identified by Yannakakis and Togelius (2015).

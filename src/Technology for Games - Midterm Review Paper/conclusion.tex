\section{Conclusion}
This paper highlights the challenge of establishing a unified game design framework.
Games consists of numerous moving parts which constantly influence each other.
As they continue to become more complex these interconnections grow as well.
Designers need to be able to decompose games in an abstract way in order to understand different components and how they contribute to the final experience.
The authors of MTDA+N manage to integrate the two previous design frameworks (MDA and the elemental tetrad) while also further exploring the narrative component.
However, they are aware that it still does not cover all areas of games adequately.
For example the role and nature of the player is mostly disregarded in their model.
Artificial intelligence is also lacking in the common game design frameworks.
The various research fields bear potential for all areas of game design.
Especially challenges in interactive storytelling can be tackled differently using AI technology.

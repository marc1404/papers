\section{Elemental Tetrad} \label{sec:elemental-tetrad}
\citeauthor{Schell2014} created the \textit{elemental tetrad} in 2008 in the first edition of his book as a design tool to dissect games into their four basic components (Figure \ref{fig:elemental-tetrad}.
The four components include: (1) Mechanics, (2) story, (3) aesthetics, and (4) technology.
Figure \ref{fig:elemental-tetrad} visualizes the classification of aesthetics as being the most visible, with mechanics and story taking the middle ground, and finally technology being the less visible layer.

Mechanics (Section \ref{sec:mechanics}) and story (Section \ref{sec:story}) according to \citeauthor{Schell2014} are covered in greater detail in this paper.
Aesthetics cover how a player's senses perceive a game: Visuals, sounds, smells, tastes, and haptic feeling.
Due to their apparent nature they are a crucial part of the experience.
The MDA framework (Section \ref{sec:mda}) and MTDA+N framework (Section \ref{sec:mtda+n}) discuss aesthetics in detail.
Technology refers to all physical and virtual media allowing to play a game.
This spans simple materials such as pen and paper as well as digital software powering videogames.

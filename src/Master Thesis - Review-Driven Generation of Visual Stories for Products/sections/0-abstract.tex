The prevalent success of e-commerce platforms has established ratings and reviews as the de-facto mechanism for consumers to build a knowledge base about products.
Review aggregation websites such as \textit{RateBeer} collect thousands of reviews for each product (i.e., beer) on their platform.
Extracting the actual characteristics of a product from an abundance of reviews becomes a challenging task for users.
This paper proposes the \textit{Beerlytics} system which aims to generate visual stories of these products summarizing their core essence.
It uses word embedding algorithms to train vector space models for each product using their associated user-contributed reviews.
Using cluster centroids to create representative yet diverse summaries of a set of reviews.
The vector space models provide the basis for nearest neighbor keyword extraction.
Valuable insights into a product are provided by finding the closest words of a query in vector space.
User testing on a frontend prototype using the generated information measures the effectiveness of the system.

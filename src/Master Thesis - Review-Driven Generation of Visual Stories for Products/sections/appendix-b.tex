        \item Regional search function
        \item Search for keyword

        \item Show more information about a user, e.g., average rating
        \item Add label to user review count, number alone doesn't suffice
        \item Judging trustworthiness of reviews: Is it relevant for me? Is it specific to a region?

        \item User review heatmap not necessarily useful, what does it tell me?
        \item Implement positivity/negativity score for keywords
        \item There's a sweet spot for review length, neither too short nor too long
        \item Recognize average and deviating reviews, "Is it a controversial review?"
        \item Highlight keywords in reviews
    \end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

    \textbf{I2.T1:} 09. July 2018 13:50; Amsterdam, The Netherlands
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Keywords need to be refined, StarSpace keywords are rather good
        \item Using "unhealthy" as maximum for calories scale is a tad aggressive
        \item IBU scale is useful
        \item Recognize and filter duplicate keywords
        \item Keywords chart is useful and interesting
        \item Some keywords are weird, could be improved
        \item Default zoom of user's reviews heatmap should be optimized
        \item Heatmap requires a scale
        \item Rating radar chart is intuitive to understand
        \item It's interesting to see differences between user rating and average rating for a beer
        \item Showing short reviews is good too
        \item Rating scales should be more consistent
        \item Show count for how many reviews are visible
        \item Showing full review blocks is fine since only a subset of the total reviews is shown
        \item Age of review should be considered
        \item Places map helps to get and idea where a beer is based
        \item "Neat!"
        \item Current layout requires a lot of scrolling
        \item Calories should be more specified, "Calories per what?"
    \end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\hfill

\begin{flushleft}
    \textbf{I2.T2:} 09. July 2018 14:15; Amsterdam, The Netherlands
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Layout is good, division between reviews and quick facts
        \item Keywords chart requires a scale
        \item Places map is useful
        \item Provide a search function for places map
        \item Fix tag links with spaces
        \item "Isn't every beer unhealthy?"
        \item Calories scale was shortly confusing
        \item Being able to compare ratings in radar chart is good
        \item Showing rating count of users is important
        \item Show similar beers
        \item Might be useful to show since when a user has been active
        \item Design looks nice
    \end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
    \textbf{I2.T3:} 09. July 2018 14:30; Amsterdam, The Netherlands
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It's intuitive to recognize the official description
        \item Keywords chart should have a scale, hard to understand otherwise
        \item Using "unhealthy" as maximum of calories scale is questionable
        \item Not directly clear what is meant by average user rating in radar chart
        \item Consider age of reviews, "Maybe the recipe changed or taste"
        \item Link to user profile page, it's interesting to know more about a reviewer
        \item Keywords chart is very interesting, quality could be improved
    \end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\hfill

\begin{flushleft}
    \textbf{I2.T4:} 10. July 2018 10:45; Amsterdam, The Netherlands
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Show list of ingredients, important for people with allergies
        \item Image of beer seems off in the layout, not neatly aligned
        \item User heatmap is interesting
        \item Using a radar chart for visualizing ratings is a good choice for comparisons
        \item Quality of keywords could be improved
        \item Show star rating scale for reviews too, parsing radar charts takes longer
        \item Relying on hover for showing detailed values in charts can be dangerous since it's easy to miss
        \item StarSpace seems to offer more interesting reviews and relevant keywords
        \item Keywords usually roughly aligned between the different algorithms
        \item Separate image box with different images, e.g., beer in a glass
        \item Bitterness scale is very useful, allows to avoid very bitter beers
        \item Information about bottle and keg availability could be included
        \item Showing similar beers would be a nice addition
        \item Colors in rating radar chart should be fixed, seemingly random change is confusing
        \item Calories scale, including minimum and maximum labels, is very good
        \item Official description could be more structured
        \item User heatmap could use a different label since it's based on the beers a user has written reviews about
        \item Info button next to rating radar chart to explain functionality if required
        \item Backlinking to RateBeer is a good idea
        \item Places map is interesting
        \item Future iterations could include buttons for editing or writing a review
        \item Ratings should be even more uniform
        \item User heatmap is somewhat useful but doesn't add anything for understanding the beer
        \item Specify calories per what
    \end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

    \textbf{I2.T5:} 10. July 2018 13:00; Amsterdam, The Netherlands
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Style score is confusing, could also be number of a beer style
        \item Keywords is a good idea but too small and a word cloud might be a better visualization
        \item Unclear what user heatmap is based on, label should be changed and a regular map with pins might suffice
        \item Not clear what's meant by average user rating in radar chart comparison
        \item Same label should be used for average rating chart and beer rating in comparison
        \item "Bottle" keyword renders rather useless results
        \item Reduce amount of keywords in order to reduce clutter
        \item Star rating should show inactive stars
        \item IBU scale is a good addition
        \item Use hover/click info for IBU instead of link
        \item Context for calories is very useful
        \item No immediate difference visible between embeddings
        \item Quick facts on the side are rather small and easy to miss
        \item Radar charts could be bigger in order to improve readability
        \item Future iterations could allow to show more/all reviews and different sorting modes
        \item GloVe seems to favor short, one-line reviews
        \item Highlighting keywords in reviews helps
        \item Quick facts should be moved to the main block
        \item Small Google Maps are usually not very useful, zoom on country level, help user to navigate
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{I2.T6:} 13. July 2018 15:00; Amsterdam, The Netherlands
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beerlytics has a better design compared to RateBeer
        \item Minimalistic design is nice and easy on the eyes
        \item Reviews should be more pronounced somehow, maybe a light-grey backdrop
        \item Should be clearer that reviews are separate from sidebar info on the right
        \item Dark-grey as font color is a good choice
        \item Possibly move image to right side of the official description text
        \item Consider showing less keywords, e.g., 5 or 6 instead of 10
        \item Reduce noise in keywords
        \item Keyword insights are interesting and useful, fun to play around with and explore
        \item Make it possible to change amount of visible keywords
        \item Collapse lower part of reviews in order to reduce amount of visible charts and maps
        \item Fix colors in rating radar chart
        \item Tags are rather uninteresting, could be moved below places map
        \item Beer style and alcohol by volume should be more visible and better aligned with heading
        \item Reviews seem to be pretty old
        \item "Unhealthy" label in calories scale should be changed to, e.g., "high-calories"
    \end{itemize}

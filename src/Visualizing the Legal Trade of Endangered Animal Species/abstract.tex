Biodiversity is on a sharp decline due to human interference. Over-exploitation through hunting, poaching, and catching animals is the second biggest contributor to this irreversible destruction. While certain luxury products are blacklisted from trading there is an ongoing global trade with endangered wildlife species. This paper proposes a visualization which aims to create awareness for the legal trade of endangered animal species. Its dataset is derived from the database of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and information from the International Union for Conservation (IUCN) API. The visualization is explored with respect to the concept, interaction design, evaluation design, visual analytics design, storytelling design, and visual thinking design.

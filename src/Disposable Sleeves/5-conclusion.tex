\section{Conclusion \& Future Work} \label{sec:conclusion}

All in all, Disposable Sleeves has been realised according to its initial motivation and design.
It extracts the deathrun game mode into a standalone multiplayer game while also providing a surrounding story.
While it can be argued that neither the gameplay nor the story is an original element this crossover, to my best knowledge, has not been done before.
Furthermore, deathrun continues to be a popular game mode even after 14 years since Counter-Strike: Source has been published.
Numerous servers host game sessions in CSS while even disregarding other games featuring the same game mode.

The current implementation provides a strong basis for further exploration.
Firstly, stateful servers should be implemented with persistent player names, scores, and credits.
Rewarding players with credits or subtracting them for re-sleeving would further mimic the reality of Altered Carbon and provide an interesting, competitive gameplay element for players.
Secondly, the story should be integrated into the game which introduces players to the concept.
Finally, as only one static level is implemented potential is hidden in randomized or procedural level generation.
Traps and safe-platforms are essentially building blocks which could be arranged in a modular fashion.

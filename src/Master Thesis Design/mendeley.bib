LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

abstract = {Document summarization provides an instrument for faster understanding the collection of text documents and has a number of real life applications. Semantic similarity and clustering can be utilized efficiently for generating effective summary of large text collections. Summarizing large volume of text is a challenging and time consuming problem particularly while considering the semantic similarity computation in summarization process. Summarization of text collection involves intensive text processing and computations to generate the summary. MapReduce is proven state of art technology for handling Big Data. In this paper, a novel framework based on MapReduce technology is proposed for summarizing large text collection. The proposed technique is designed using semantic similarity based clustering and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for summarizing the large text collection over MapReduce framework. The summarization task is performed in four stages and provides a modular implementation of multiple documents summarization. The presented technique is evaluated in terms of scalability and various text summarization parameters namely, compression ratio, retention ratio, ROUGE and Pyramid score are also measured. The advantages of MapReduce framework are clearly visible from the experiments and it is also demonstrated that MapReduce provides a faster implementation of summarizing large text collections and is a powerful tool in Big Text Data analysis.},

abstract = {Product reviews have become an important resource for customers before they make purchase decisions. However, the abundance of reviews makes it difficult for customers to digest them and make informed choices. In our study, we aim to help customers who want to quickly capture the main idea of a lengthy product review before they read the details. In contrast with existing work on review analysis and document summarization, we aim to retrieve a set of real-world user questions to summarize a review. In this way, users would know what questions a given review can address and they may further read the review only if they have similar questions about the product. Specifically, we design a two-stage approach which consists of question selection and question diversification. For question selection phase, we first employ probabilistic retrieval models to locate candidate questions that are relevant to a given review. A Recurrent Neural Network Encoder--Decoder is utilized to measure the ``answerability'' of questions to a review. We then design a set function to re-rank the questions with the goal of rewarding diversity in the final question set. The set function satisfies submodularity and monotonicity, which results in an efficient greedy algorithm of submodular optimization. Evaluation on product reviews from two categories shows that the proposed approach is effective for discovering meaningful questions that are representative of individual reviews.},

As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them in order to make a decision on whether to buy the product. In this project, we aim to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we are only interested in the specific features of the product that customers have opinions on and also whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting or rewriting a subset of the original sentences from the reviews to capture their main points as in the classic text summarization. In this paper, we only focus on mining opinion/product features that the reviewers have commented on. A number of techniques are presented to mine such features. Our experimental results show that these techniques are highly effective.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatic visual summarization of a geographic area that exploits user-contributed images and related explicit and implicit metadata collected from popular content-sharing websites. By means of this approach, we search for a limited number of representative but diverse images to represent the area within a certain radius around a specific location. Our approach is based on the random walk with restarts over a graph that models relations between images, visual features extracted from them, associated text, as well as the information on the uploader and commentators. In addition to introducing a novel edge weighting mechanism, we propose in this paper a simple but effective scheme for selecting the most representative and diverse set of images based on the information derived from the graph. We also present a novel evaluation protocol, which does not require input of human annotators, but only exploits the geographical coordinates accompanying the images in order to reflect conditions on image sets that must necessarily be fulfilled in order for users to find them representative and diverse. Experiments performed on a collection of Flickr images, captured around 207 locations in Paris, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel approach to selecting images suitable for inclusion in the visual summaries. The approach is grounded in insights about how people summarize image collections. We utilize the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform to obtain a large number of manually created visual summaries as well as information about criteria for image inclusion in the summary. Based on these large-scale user tests, we propose an automatic image selection approach, which jointly utilizes the analysis of image content, context, popularity, visual aesthetic appeal as well as the sentiment derived from the comments posted on the images. In our approach we do not describe images based on their properties only, but also in the context of semantically related images, which improves robustness and effectively enables propagation of sentiment, aesthetic appeal as well as various inherent attributes associated with a particular group of images. We discuss the phenomenon of a low inter-user agreement, which makes an automatic evaluation of visual summaries a challenging task and propose a solution inspired by the text summarization and machine translation communities. The experiments performed on a collection of geo-referenced Flickr images demonstrate the effectiveness of our image selection approach.},

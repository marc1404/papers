\begin{abstract}
The goal of this paper is to provide an extensive overview of current game literature venturing beyond games serving merely entertainment purposes.
It spans the research areas of virtual characters with player avatars and intelligent agents; serious gaming which primarily builds on intrinsic motivation; enhanced gaming as an umbrella term for adaptive games, virtual reality, and haptics; and finally ontologies to describe games in a formal and precise way.

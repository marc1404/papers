\section{Enhanced Gaming} \label{sec:enhanced-gaming}
The traditional gaming experience can be enhanced using different techniques focusing on various aspects of the experience.
Adaptive games (section \ref{sec:adaptive-games}) are concerned with generating spaces and missions depending on the player.
Furthermore, the player profile is exploitable for adjusting the difficulty in a dynamic way as well.
Virtual reality (section \ref{sec:virtual-reality}) provides a fully immersive visual experience which incorporates the user's position and orientation.
Finally, haptics provide tactile feedback (section \ref{sec:haptics}) being a crucial building brick for advancing virtual reality from the visual and aural experience.
